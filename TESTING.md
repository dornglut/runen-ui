# RunenUI Testing and Validation

The canonical merge-readiness command is:

```text
cargo validate
```

It is repository-owned and read-only. The baseline includes stable formatting checks, locked workspace tests, Clippy with denied warnings, Rust 1.93.0 MSRV tests, repository metadata and authority audits, public API checks, unsafe-code checks, documentation consistency, and workspace-root Markdown link validation.

For intentional Rust edits, format first with:

```text
cargo +stable fmt --all
```

Also run the focused tests and conformance proofs owned by the active issue, followed by `git diff --check`. Exact-head GitHub Actions evidence must refer to the current reviewed head; an earlier successful run is not reusable after the head moves.

The maintained command inventory, CI relationship, audit details, and infrastructure-only waiver policy are documented in:

- [Validation details](docs/tooling/validation.md)
- [Work-tracking and evidence rules](docs/work-tracking.md)
- [M4 conformance matrix](docs/architecture/m4-conformance-matrix.md)

CI may invoke `cargo validate` through shared orchestration, but shared workflows do not own or recreate RunenUI validation semantics.
